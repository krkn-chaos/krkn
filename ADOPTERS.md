| MarketAxess | 2024 | https://www.marketaxess.com/ | Kraken enables us to achieve our goal of increasing the reliability of our cloud products on Kubernetes. The tool allows us to automatically run various chaos scenarios, identify resilience and performance bottlenecks, and seamlessly restore the system to its original state once scenarios finish. These chaos scenarios include pod disruptions, node (EC2) outages, simulating availability zone (AZ) outages, and filling up storage spaces like EBS and EFS. The community is highly responsive to requests and works on expanding the tool's capabilities. MarketAxess actively contributes to the project, adding features such as the ability to leverage existing network ACLs and proposing several feature improvements to enhance test coverage. |
