## Krkn Roadmap

Following are a list of enhancements that we are planning to work on adding support in Krkn. Of course any help/contributions are greatly appreciated.

- [x] [Ability to run multiple chaos scenarios in parallel under load to mimic real world outages](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/424)
- [x] [Centralized storage for chaos experiments artifacts](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/423)
- [x] [Support for causing DNS outages](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/394)
- [x] [Chaos recommender](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/tree/main/utils/chaos-recommender) to suggest scenarios having probability of impacting the service under test using profiling results 
- [x] Chaos AI integration to improve test coverage while reducing fault space to save costs and execution time [krkn-chaos-ai](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn-chaos-ai)
- [x] [Support for pod level network traffic shaping](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/393)
- [ ] [Ability to visualize the metrics that are being captured by Kraken and stored in Elasticsearch](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/124)
- [x] Support for running all the scenarios of Kraken on Kubernetes distribution - see https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/185, https://github.com/redhat-chaos/krkn/issues/186
- [x] Continue to improve [Chaos Testing Guide](https://krkn-chaos.github.io/krkn) in terms of adding best practices, test environment recommendations and scenarios to make sure the OpenShift platform, as well the applications running on top it, are resilient and performant under chaotic conditions.
- [x] [Switch documentation references to Kubernetes](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/495)
- [x] [OCP and Kubernetes functionalities segregation](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/497)
- [x] [Krknctl - client for running Krkn scenarios with ease](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krknctl)
- [x] [AI Chat bot to help get started with Krkn and commands](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn-lightspeed)
- [ ] [Ability to roll back cluster to original state if chaos fails](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/804)
- [ ] Add recovery time metrics to each scenario for better regression analysis
- [ ] [Add resiliency scoring to chaos scenarios ran on cluster](https://github.com/krkn-chaos/krkn/issues/125)
