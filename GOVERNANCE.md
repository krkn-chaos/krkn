The governance model adopted here is heavily influenced by a set of CNCF projects, especially drew
reference from [Kubernetes governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md).
*For similar structures some of the same wordings from kubernetes governance are borrowed to adhere
to the originally construed meaning.*

## Principles

- **Open**: Krkn is open source community.
- **Welcoming and respectful**: See [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
- **Transparent and accessible**: Work and collaboration should be done in public.
  Changes to the Krkn organization, Krkn code repositories, and CNCF related activities (e.g.
  level, involvement, etc) are done in public.
- **Merit**: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit
  and alignment with project objectives, scope and design principles.
